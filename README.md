# Entropy

#### Simple command line app for computing the entropy


```bash
☁  entropy [master] ⚡ ./entropy 
numbers of instances = 14
number of nodes = 4
number of atributes for every node = 2

add every atirbute in the node
Node 0 , atribute 0 = 9
Node 0 , atribute 1 = 5
Node 1 , atribute 0 = 6
Node 1 , atribute 1 = 3
Node 2 , atribute 0 = 4
Node 2 , atribute 1 = 0
Node 3 , atribute 0 = 2
Node 3 , atribute 1 = 3
Entropy of this node 0 is H[x] = 0.940286
Entropy of this node 1 is H[x] = 0.918296
Entropy of this node 2 is H[x] = 0.000000
Entropy of this node 3 is H[x] = 0.970951
Information gain for this entry IG(x) = 0.003185
```
